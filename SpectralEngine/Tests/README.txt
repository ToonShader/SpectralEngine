--- Runtime Image Tests ---
USE: Allows developer to diff the rendering of the scene against established baselines to catch subtle regressions.
     Recommended that an image diff tool be used.

Extensions:
D - Default launch window (800x600)
M - Maximized launch window (~1920x1080 slightly less due to window borders)
F - Fullscreen window (1920x1080)


--- Performance Tests ---
For now, these are just performance tests against my desktop to catch performance regressions.
This will be extended in the future to include different runtime environments.
